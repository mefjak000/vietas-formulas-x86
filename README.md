# Vieta's Formulas in x86 Assembly

## Overview

This repository contains an implementation of Vieta's formulas in x86 assembly language. Vieta's formulas relate the coefficients of a polynomial to sums and products of its roots. The project demonstrates low-level programming and mathematical concepts using assembly language.

## Example

For a polynomial \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\):

- Input coefficients: `a`, `b`, and `c`
- Output:
  - Sum of roots: \(-b/a\)
  - Product of roots: \(c/a\)
